# Sentiment-Analysis-using-RNN-and-LSTM-Architectures
This project implements a sentiment analysis system using a RNN and an LSTM in PyTorch. Text reviews are preprocessed, tokenized, and encoded into numerical sequences, then passed through an embedding layer and a multi-layer RNN and LSTM to classify sentiments as positive or negative, with reproducible training settings.
